New Belgium brewery wants some help turning the comments data they collect during their beer tastings into statistically analyzable data.  They want to turn comments like "cheesy" into a tag like Isovaleric2 (where the 2 describes the intensity of the flavor).

This project is due in-part to the success of Jan Van Zeghbroeck's project:

It will make heavy use of spaCy:

and possibly this word cloud generator:
