> To determine if a batch of beer meets New Belgium's quality standards, the beer is rated by 20 - 30 expert tasters and from this data, the gatekeeper makes the final call.  Currently, the gatekeeper has to dicipher up to 6 free text comment fields per taster, this project provides an accurate summary with the click of one button

New Belgium brewery wants some help turning the comments data they collect during their beer tastings into statistically analyzable data.  They want to turn comments like "cheesy" into a tag like Isovaleric2 (where the 2 describes the intensity of the flavor).
