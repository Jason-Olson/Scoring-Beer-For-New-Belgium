# nlp_on_taster_comments
What the professionals are saying about beer

New Belgium brewery wants some help turning the comments data they collect during their beer tastings into statistically analyzable data.  They want to turn comments like "cheesy" into a tag like Isovaleric2 (where the 2 describes the intensity of the flavor).

This project is due in-part to the success of Jan Van Zeghbroeck's project:

It will make heavy use of spaCy:

and possibly this word cloud generator:
